# ESP32-DevBoard-Breakout
A simple breakout board for 30 Pin ESP32 development boards.

I love using ESP32 development boards and I wanted an excuse to design my first PCB. I kept the requirements simple because I wanted a flexible board:

* Female headers for the ESP32 development board.
* Male and female headers for each pin.
* Screw terminals for each pin.
* A small OLED screen.
* An external 5v power input.
* Separate breakouts for servo motors.
